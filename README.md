# cv-crop-detection-sugarbeets
This repo is an extract of our student project at University of Mannheim dealing with crop detection for sugarbeet plants. We tried out several models, however, in this repo, I only provide my approach using a Resnet18 as a backbone of a UNET. You can also find my final results and findings in the .pdf handout provided.

The dataset used was provided by Nived Chebrolu; Philipp Lottes; Alexander Schaefer; Wera Winterhalter; Wolfram Burgard; Cyrill Stachniss (2017): Agricultural robot dataset for plant classification, localization and mapping on sugar beet fields. In: The International Journal of Robotics Research. DOI: 10.1177/0278364917720510.
